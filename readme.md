This project is mid-development so bugs and missing features are expected. The tool has partial gitbook [documentation](https://chasekanipe.gitbook.io/modality/) in addition to several [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5k2-CzbGSTRkCp7_L4RRudVaIVdKx3pT).

## Goals

This project intends to
 - Better integrate symbolic execution with the rest of the reverse engineering process
 - Provide a faster alternative to using angr than the python bindings
 - Allow for switching between concrete and symbolic execution (this feature is coming soon)
 - Provide useful visualizations of the angr backend
 - Include a suite of features for vulnerability detection, exploit generation, etc (coming soon)
