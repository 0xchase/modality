# Visualization

## State locations

Modality will add highlights to radare2's visual mode at each state location. Active states are highlighted in blue, and deadended states are highlighted in red. Comments with the state index are also added at these locations, making killing/extracting states more efficient. 

Note: You'll have to press `r` to refresh the graph view each time a command is run for the highlights to update until I figure out how to make it auto-refresh.

More visualizations coming soon.
