# Visualization

## State locations

Modality will add highlights to radare2's visual mode at each state location. Active states are highlighted in blue, and deadended states are highlighted in red. Comments with the state index are also added at these locations, making killing/extracting states more efficient. 

## Other

More visualizations coming soon.
